Applications of Machine Learning to the LambdaCDM-model
=======

Bachelors thesis written in spanish about applications of machine learning to the LambdaCDM model

Abstract:
-------------

The $\Lambda$CDM model is the standard cosmological model used to describe the evolution of the universe on a large scale. It is based on the theory of general relativity and is developed by applying the Einstein equations under certain simplifications. By analyzing analytical and numerical solutions of the model, we will explore the predictions it makes for different types of universes. Additionally, we will estimate the parameters that model our universe using modern measurements of the Hubble variable through three different methods: median calculation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and the introduction of neural networks. Finally, we will compare our results with those of the Planck experiment and observe the discrepancies that arise in the $\Lambda$CDM model between the study of supernovae and the cosmic microwave background.
